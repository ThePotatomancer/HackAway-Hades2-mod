# Mod name

Rehauls the axe weapon, to fix some of the glaring issues that me and others found problematic .
if you are sick of getting hit due to poorly timing the block or hate avoiding the charge time "upgrades" for the axe special,
this mod is for you.

## Features

current list of changes:
* when the block special is fully charged, instead of instantly unleashing the omega special, there is a grace period of 1 second where you can freely unleash the omega special. you keep on blocking attack during the grace period!
*
